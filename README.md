I'm a Junior Frontend Engineer working at Purplebricks. I left a 10 year primary school teaching career to learn fullstack development at the School of Code bootcamp in Birmingham. I really enjoy the frontend, I want to learn all I can about React and I'd love to learn about animating SVGs and D3 for data visualisation.
